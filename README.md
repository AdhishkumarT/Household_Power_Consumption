Introduction:

The Household Power Consumption Analysis project leverages data analytics and visualization techniques to analyze energy usage patterns in a household. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights into power consumption trends, peak usage times, and overall energy efficiency. This project provides a comprehensive view of energy utilization, helping users understand and optimize their power consumption habits.

Key Features:

Energy Distribution Analysis: Explore the distribution of energy usage across different time frames (hourly, daily, weekly).
Peak Usage Identification: Identify periods of high power consumption to encourage energy-saving practices.
Relationship Exploration: Analyze the relationship between global active power and other household features.
Time-Series Insights: Visualize temporal trends in power usage to highlight patterns or anomalies.
Energy Usage Categorization: Compare energy consumption during peak vs. non-peak hours and study usage by day of the week.
